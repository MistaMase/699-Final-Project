# 699-Final-Project

## Requirements
run <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>

## Running The Program
python3 main.py

## Trained Model
If you have a trained model no additional arguments are needed. The code assumes a model file named 'model_filter.h5' As long as it's in the same directory everything should be fine. If you don't have a trained model, on line 10 of LiveImageClassifier provide an argument of <code>train_model=True</code>. This will train the model and then begin image capture.
